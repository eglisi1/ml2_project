# Structure

In this directory, we will create a sentiment model using the IMDB dataset.
For a detailed explanation have a look at the notebook `01_create_sentiment_model.ipynb`.

In the python file we will create a model for each config file in the `configs/model` directory.
The model will be saved in the `models` directory.
